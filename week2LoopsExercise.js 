// Week 2 - Loops

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code. 
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Write a 'while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
let x=0;
  let wholeNum=" ";
  while(x<6){
    wholeNum+= x+ ",";
      x+=1;
    
  }

console.log(wholeNum)
// Exercise 2. Write a 'do while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

let wholeNum1=" ";
  let i = 0;
  do {
    wholeNum1+=i+ ",";
    i+=1;
  }
  while (i < 6);
console.log(wholeNum1);
// Exercise 3. Write a 'for' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
let wholeNum3=" ";
for(let i=0; i<6; i+=1){
    wholeNum3+=i+",";
   
}
console.log(wholeNum3);

// Exercise 4. Now we want a loop that prints the integers 
// counting DOWN from 10 to 1 (inclusive). Write three loops that do this, to practice
// writing loops in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.
let a =10;
let num1=" ";
while(a>0){
   
    num1+=a+ ",";
    a-=1;
};
console.log(num1)

// do while loop
let num2=" ";
let k=10;
do{
    num2+=k +","
    k-=1;
}while(k>0);

console.log(num2)

//for loop
let num3=" ";
for(a=10;a>0; a-=1){
    num3+=a+ ",";
}
console.log(num3);
// Exercise 5. Write a loop that prints the integers from 7 to 27. Write this 
// loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

let b=7;
let number1=" ";
while(b<=27){
    number1+=b+ ",";
    b+=1;
}; 
console.log(number1);

// Do While Loop
  let d = 7;
 let number2=" ";
  do{
    number2+=d+",";
    d+=1;
}while(d<=27);
console.log(number2);

// For Loop 
let number3=" ";
for (let c=7; c<=27; c+=1){
    number3+=c +" ,"
}
console.log(number3)
// Exercise 6. Write a loop that prints numbers between 0 and 100, counting by tens.
// I.e. it will print 10, then 20, then 30, etc. 
// Write this loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.

// while loop
let f=0;
let n=" ";
while(f<101){
    n+=f + " ,";
    f+=10;
}
console.log(n);

// do while loop
let e=0;
let n1=" ";
do {
    n1+=e+ ",";
    e+=10;
}while(e<101);
console.log(n1);
// for loop

let n2=" ";
for(let i=0; i<101;i+=10){
    n2+=i +" ," ;
}
console.log(n2);
// Exercise 7. Add a comment as to why the following loop is an infinite loop (will 
// run without ever stopping). Then fix the loop so that it stops when
// counterFour is equal to -100.

//The loop is infinite because there have infinite negative numbers that is less than 2. 
let counterFour = 1;
let result1=" ";
while (counterFour < 2) {
    result1+=console.log("Help Me!"+ " ");
    counterFour--;
    if (counterFour ===-101){
        break;
    }
}
console.log(result1);


// Exercise 8. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer. Write a loop 
// (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to that number.
let print="";
for(let h=0; h<=39; h+=3){
   print+=h + " , ";
};
console.log(print);

// Exercise 9. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer (this time make sure it's 
// less than 100). Write a loop (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to 100.
// Next to each number it should print "not my favorite number". But next to your favorite
// number it should print "my favorite number!". Example output (if your favorite number was 2):
// 0 not my favorite number
// 1 not my favorite number
// 2 my favorite number!
// 3 not my favorite number
// ...
// (Hint - use an if statement in your loop)
let result=" ";
for (let j=0; j<=100; j++){
   
    if ((j<=100) && (j!=39)){
        result+=j + " ,not my favorite number!<br>"
    }else if(j=39){
     result+=j + " , my favorite number!<br> " ;
     }
}
console.log(result);
// Exercise 10. In some of the exercises above, we had you write all 3 types of loops, for practice.
// But in real life, how would you decide which type of loop to use? You might not have an
// exact answer, but spend a few minutes thinking about the different types of loops and/or 
// doing some research and write down your thoughts in a comment below:
//


// Exercise 11. Now we'll practice using nested loops (a loop inside another loop)!
// Update the nested loops below to so that for each value of outsideCounter,
// the inside loop will show a countdown

/*
counting down from 0
*********************************** 
counting down from 1
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 2
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 3
inside 3
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
*/

 

for (let outsideCounter = 0; outsideCounter <= 3; outsideCounter+=1) {
  console.log("counting down from", outsideCounter);
  for (let insideCounter = outsideCounter; insideCounter <=3; insideCounter-=1) {
      console.log("inside", insideCounter);
      if(insideCounter == 0){
          break;
      }
  }
  console.log("***********************************")
}


// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? If you used references, which ones helped you? 
// Please answer in a comment below.
// It is not to hard. Some questions I used W3School as a reference to help me solve the qustions.
