<html>
<body>
	Animals:
	<ol id="ol1">
		<li>Frog</li>
		<li>Dog</li>
		<li>Bunny</li>
	</ol>

	<div id="id1">
		<p>This is the text in div id1</p>
		<p>Hope you enjoy my HTML</p>
	</div>

	<p id="id2">Here's some text in a paragraph</p>

	<div class="myClass">
		I love learning about HTML and JavaScript
	</div>

	<p class="myClass">
		Coding is fun
	</p>

	<button id="button1">Button 1</button>
	<br/><br/>
	<button id="button2">Button 2</button>
</body>

<script type="text/javascript">
// Exercise 1: Select the element with id "id2" and change the text inside it to "Here's some new text"
    let js2 = document.getElementById("id2").textContent;
    js2.textContent="Here's some new text";
// Exercise 2: Select the element with id "id1" and make the text inside it green.
    let js1=document.getElementById("id1");
	js1.style.color="green";
// Exercise 3: Select the elements that have the class "myClass". console.log the output.
let myClass1=document.querySelectorAll(".myClass");
   let value=myClass1[0].textContent;
   let value2=myClass1[1].textContent;
  
console.log(value);
console.log(value2);
// Exercise 4: Select the children of the element with id "id1". console.log the output.
let content=js1.textContent;
console.log(content);
// Exercise 5: Select all list items on the page. console.log the output.
let list =document.querySelector("#ol1");

listValue=list.textContent;
console.log(listValue);
// Exercise 6: Use JavaScript to find the *number* of list items on the page. console.log the output.
let listItem=list.getElementsByTagName("li")
let length=listItem.length
console.log(length);
// Exercise 7: Using JavaScript, create a list item and add it to the end of the ordered list.
let newListLable=document.createElement("li");
newListLable.textContent="Cat";
list.appendChild(newListLable);
// Exercise 8: Using JavaScript, make it so that when button1 is clicked, 
// an alert pops up saying "Hi from Techtonica".
let firstBtn=document.querySelector("#button1");
firstBtn.addEventListener("click",()=>{
	alert("Hi from Techtonica");
});
// Exercise 9: In your own words, write a few sentences explaining what the DOM is. Write your answer in a comment below:
//Dom represents a page that consist of the parent nodes and child nodes, which can use it to change the page structure.
// The next two exercises combine the DOM with other JavaScript you've learned. Try them for an extra challenge!
// Exercise 10: Select the elements with the class "myClass" and update the text inside each of them to end with "!"
// Hint: To operate on multiple elements, you can use a loop.

for (let i=0;i<myClass1.length;i++){
	
	myClass1[0].textContent=value +"!";
	myClass1[1].textContent=value2 + "!";
}

// Exercise 11: Make it so when the button2 is clicked, 
// the children of the element with id "id1" each have their text replaced with a random number 1-100
function random(num){
	return randomNum=Math.floor(Math.random()*num)+1;
}

 let secondBtn = document.querySelector("#button2");

 secondBtn.addEventListener("click", ()=>{
	 js1.innerHTML=random(100)+"<br>"+random(100);
	
 })
